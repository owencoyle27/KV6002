# KV6002


# This is the start of our GitHub - I'll write this up as a tutorial, but for those of you that understand Git well, the main branch requires a pull request, so any changes will have to be made in seperate branches.

# This as a tutorial will be written up for the weekend starting 20/02/21, so we should be good to go from then on GitHub.
